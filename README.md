## Description

In recent trend in world wide Lockdowns due to COVID19 outbreak, as Face Mask is became mandatory for everyone while roaming outside, approach of Deep Learning for Detecting Faces With and Without mask were a good trendy practice. Here I have created a model that detects face mask trained on 7553 images with 3 color channels (RGB).

### Dataset

This dataset consists of 7553 images belonging to two classes:

* with_mask: 3725 images
* without_mask: 3828 images
